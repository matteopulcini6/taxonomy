  - answer: >
      The hypothesis is that increasing temperature will increase the rate of
      plant growth.
    question: What is the hypothesis of the experiment?
    context: >
      A group of plants is subjected to different temperature conditions,
      ranging from 20°C to 40°C, while other environmental factors such as
      light, water, and soil composition are kept constant. The height of the
      plants is measured daily over a period of four weeks. 
  - answer: >
      The independent variable is the temperature, while the dependent variable
      is the rate of plant growth.
    question: What are the independent and dependent variables in this experiment?
    context: >
      After four weeks of observation, the data shows that plants grown at
      higher temperatures exhibited faster growth rates compared to those grown
      at lower temperatures.
  - answer: >
      The conclusion is that there is a positive correlation between temperature
      and the rate of plant growth.
    question: What conclusion can be drawn from the data?
